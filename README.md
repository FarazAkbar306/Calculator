# Calculator Project

Hey there! 👋 This is a simple yet stylish calculator I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's got a modern design with a nice gradient background and some cool hover effects.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Clear all functionality (AC button)
- Delete last digit (DEL button)
- Sleek gradient background
- Responsive buttons with shadow effects
- Clean, modern interface

## How It Works

The calculator has a simple and intuitive interface:
- Type numbers using the number buttons
- Use operators (+, -, ×, ÷) for calculations
- Hit '=' to see your result
- Made a mistake? Use 'DEL' to remove the last digit or 'AC' to start fresh

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling (with some nice gradients and shadows)
- Vanilla JavaScript for functionality
- Google Fonts (Poppins) for typography

## Design Highlights

- Dark theme with gradient background
- Circular buttons with hover effects
- Orange equals button for emphasis
- Green operator buttons
- Subtle shadow effects for depth

## Behind the Project

Hey! Just wanted to share that I built this calculator while I was learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 🎓 It was such a fun way to practice these technologies and understand how they work together!

If you're also learning web development, feel free to explore the code - it might help you understand these concepts better too! 💡 Sometimes the best way to learn is by building something cool, right? �
